# Java 8 Core Concepts and Projects üöÄ

This repository is a collection of my assignments and projects focused on mastering core Java concepts, with a special emphasis on the modern features introduced in **Java 8**. The code examples demonstrate the practical application of functional programming, object-oriented design, and advanced APIs.

## Project Folders and Topics üìÇ

This repository is organized into several folders, each dedicated to a specific set of concepts or a system implementation.

### `functional_interface`
This folder contains various examples of **Functional Interfaces**, a key feature of Java 8. It includes demonstrations of built-in interfaces like `Predicate`, `Function`, and `Consumer`, as well as a custom functional interface.

* `BiFunctionExample.java`
* `PredicateDemo.java`
* `ConsumerDemo.java`
* `CustomInterfaceExample.java`

### `lambda_expressions`
This folder focuses on the syntax and usage of **Lambda Expressions**. The examples show how to use lambdas to write more concise and expressive code, particularly with functional interfaces.

* `Employee.java` (The model class)
* `LambdaExamples.java` (Demonstrations of lambda usage)

### `stream_api`
This folder provides hands-on examples of the **Java Stream API**. The code illustrates how to perform powerful and efficient data processing operations on collections.

* `IntermediateOperations.java` (e.g., `filter`, `map`, `sorted`)
* `TerminalExpressions.java` (e.g., `collect`, `forEach`, `reduce`)
* `OptionalExamples.java` (Demonstrations of the `Optional` class)

### `insurance_management`
This folder contains a larger system that applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to simulate an insurance management system. It includes classes for managing insurance policies and application logic.

* `InsuranceApp.java`
* `InsurancePolicy.java`

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java 8+
* **IDE (Recommended):** IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code with Java extensions, or Eclipse

## How to Run These Projects üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To run any of the code examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or Git Bash and clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rohit1829/Java8.git](https://github.com/rohit1829/Java8.git)
    ```

2.  **Open in your IDE:**
    Import the entire `Java8` project into your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The IDE will automatically recognize the project structure and build paths.

3.  **Compile and Run:**
    * Navigate to the specific Java file you want to run within your IDE.
    * Locate the `main` method in the file (e.g., in `BiFunctionExample.java` or `InsuranceApp.java`).
    * You can then compile and run the file directly from within your IDE.

    Alternatively, you can run the files from the **command line**:
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the 'src' directory first
    cd Java8/src

    # Example for BiFunctionExample.java
    javac functional_interface/BiFunctionExample.java
    java functional_interface.BiFunctionExample
    ```
